## 📊 Sample Interactions

### Question: "What's the overall morning discharge rate?"
**Response:**
```
📊 Overall Morning Discharge Performance

Based on our physician discharge data analysis:

• Current Average: 31.2% across 22 physicians
• Industry Benchmark: 40%+ (we're below target)
• Total Discharges: 3,847 analyzed

🏆 Top Performers
• Ahmed, M: 45.2% morning rate (234 total discharges)
• Baltag, E: 42.8% morning rate (207 total discharges)
• Carson, J: 38.9% morning rate (189 total discharges)

💡 Key Insights
• 68.8% of discharges happen after noon
• Peak discharge time is 3 PM
• Morning discharges optimize bed turnover and patient flow

🎯 Recommendations
1. Study workflows of top performers
2. Implement morning discharge protocols
3. Focus on 8 AM - 12 PM discharge window
4. Target physicians with <30% morning rates
