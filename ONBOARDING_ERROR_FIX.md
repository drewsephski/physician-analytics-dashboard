# Onboarding Provider Error Fix

## üêõ Problem Identified

The error "useOnboarding must be used within an OnboardingProvider" was occurring because:

1. **Mixed Provider Usage**: The `PhysicianAnalyticsPage` was using `CourseAwareOnboardingProvider`
2. **Wrong Hook Imports**: Some components were using `useOnboarding` from the regular `onboarding-provider.tsx`
3. **Context Mismatch**: Components expecting the regular `OnboardingProvider` context were running within `CourseAwareOnboardingProvider`

## üîß Root Cause

The issue was in these components:
- `OnboardingControls` - used `useOnboarding` from `onboarding-provider.tsx`
- `ProgressIndicator` - used `useOnboarding` from `onboarding-provider.tsx`

But they were being rendered within `CourseAwareOnboardingProvider`, which provides a different context.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Components
- Temporarily removed `OnboardingControls` from `PhysicianAnalyticsPage`
- Kept `CourseProgressIndicator` which correctly uses the course-aware provider

### 2. Created Course-Aware Replacement
- Created `CourseAwareOnboardingControls` component
- Uses `useOnboarding` from `course-aware-onboarding-provider.tsx`
- Includes course progress tracking and visual feedback
- Added to onboarding exports

### 3. Updated Imports
- Updated `PhysicianAnalyticsPage` to use `CourseAwareOnboardingControls`
- Ensured all components use the correct provider context

## üéØ Components Status

### ‚úÖ Working with CourseAwareOnboardingProvider
- `CourseAwareOnboardingProvider` ‚úÖ
- `OnboardingOverlay` ‚úÖ (uses course-aware hook)
- `WelcomeModal` ‚úÖ (uses course-aware hook)
- `CourseProgressIndicator` ‚úÖ (uses course-aware hook)
- `CourseAwareOnboardingControls` ‚úÖ (new, uses course-aware hook)
- `HospitalTooltips` ‚úÖ (no hook dependency)
- `HospitalContextualHelp` ‚úÖ (no hook dependency)
- `QuickReference` ‚úÖ (no hook dependency)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Incompatible with CourseAwareOnboardingProvider
- `OnboardingControls` ‚ùå (uses regular onboarding hook)
- `ProgressIndicator` ‚ùå (uses regular onboarding hook)

## üöÄ Result

The error should now be resolved because:

1. All components in `PhysicianAnalyticsPage` use the correct provider context
2. `CourseAwareOnboardingControls` provides the same functionality as `OnboardingControls` but with course tracking
3. No components are trying to use the regular `useOnboarding` hook within `CourseAwareOnboardingProvider`

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Option 1: Unified Provider (Recommended)
Create a single provider that handles both regular onboarding and course tracking:
```typescript
// Unified provider that can work in both modes
export function UnifiedOnboardingProvider({ 
  enableCourseTracking = false, 
  children 
}) {
  // Implementation that supports both modes
}
```

### Option 2: Provider Detection
Add automatic provider detection to components:
```typescript
// Hook that works with either provider
export function useOnboardingContext() {
  // Try course-aware context first, fall back to regular
}
```

### Option 3: Explicit Provider Selection
Make provider selection explicit in component imports:
```typescript
// Clear separation of concerns
import { OnboardingControls } from './onboarding/regular';
import { CourseAwareOnboardingControls } from './onboarding/course-aware';
```

## üß™ Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/product` (PhysicianAnalyticsPage)
2. Verify no "useOnboarding must be used within an OnboardingProvider" error
3. Test onboarding controls functionality
4. Verify course progress tracking works
5. Test all onboarding features (welcome modal, overlay, etc.)

The error should now be completely resolved! üéâ
